# TripTease

## Project Description

**TripTease** is a collaborative travel planning platform designed to streamline the group travel planning process. Organizing trips with friends, family, or colleagues can become chaotic and stressful with disagreements and indecision about where to go, what to do, or where to eat. TripTease solves this problem by offering a shared space where users can suggest trip ideas and vote on them in real-time. This ensures that decisions are made democratically, reducing friction and making trip planning more enjoyable.

The platform addresses the frustration of planning group trips by centralizing suggestions, organizing activities by location, and enabling users to upvote or downvote activities. TripTease helps groups reach consensus smoothly, preventing endless discussions and confusion over plans.

## Product Vision

We envision **TripTease** as the go-to platform for planning group trips, making collaboration simple, transparent, and stress-free. The platform ensures equal input from all members while focusing on enhancing the travel experience by streamlining decision-making. By giving users the ability to suggest activities, vote on them, and mark them as completed, TripTease will empower users to enjoy the trip planning process rather than dread it. Our MVP focuses on core features that enable trip creation, activity suggestion, and voting, with plans for post-trip summaries and rating systems.

## Project History

**TripTease** was conceived as a response to the difficulties many people face when organizing group trips. Whether planning vacations with friends, reunions with family, or corporate retreats, discussions often become frustrating, resulting in confusion and indecision. Our team sought to build a platform that centralizes the planning process, giving every participant a clear and structured way to contribute to the trip.

The platform's journey began with this idea: to solve group decision-making challenges. Over time, **TripTease** evolved into a feature-rich platform, offering suggestions, real-time voting, and easy-to-use tools that bring joy back into trip planning.
