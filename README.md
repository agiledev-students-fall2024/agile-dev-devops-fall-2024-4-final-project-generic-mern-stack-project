# Marconnect

### Project Description
Marconnect is a collaboritive video conferencing platform that is designed
to meet the needs of engineers, developers, and CS educators / students.
Unlike current meeting and collaboration tools which force users to juggle
multiple platforms and context swithces between video conferencing, code editors, and other tools, Marconnect provides a unifed environment for seamless collaboration.

Marconnect aims to address the fragmented user experience that developers, educators, and satudents oftentimes face. Marconnect will integrate all the aforementioned tools, including video and audio conferencing, a collaborative whiteboard, and an interactive code editor into one program.

If time allows, Marconnect will include more advanced features such as a generative AI chatbot for technical assistance, code compilation, and group collaboration.

### Product Vision
The vision of our project is to become the go-to platform for collaborative video conferencing for developers, educators, and companies in technical fields. By eliminating the context switching and other issues as mentioned previously, we can help elevate the video conferencing experience for all users, and hopefully improve the video conferencing industry as a whole. Additionally, with future potential plans includiung AI integration, advanced security features, and a more scalable platform, we can potentially create a functional product that can be deployed at scale, beyond the scope of the AGILE course itself.

### Project History
The project was originally envisioned by the team when we realized that current video conferencing platforms have an issue -
the lack of integration with necessary services for a software developer, like a code editor. Instead, most platforms require share screen
and don't allow direct input into code, meaning code debugging and other issues are much more difficult to resolve.
