### Brief History

One of our teammates has always loved playing volleyball. The first idea was to create a platform to better connect volleyball enthusiasts to share their achievements and talent. To this end, we decided on a social media site that allows users to share and view images and texts with their connections. As we moved forward with this idea, we realized that the site does not have to be limited to volleyball enthusiasts. We wanted to create a platform that allows people with any interests to share and connect with anyone they want. As a result, we modified our project vision to be as open as possible, recognizing that people with similar interests are more likely to connect with each other and form their own respective communities within the site.

### Building and Testing the Project

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a .env file within the back-end folder and in it put the line: PORT=3000
3. Create a .env file within the front-end folder and in it put the line: REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
4. Create two new terminals: front-end and back-end. For the back-end terminal, cd into the back-end file and run the command "npm run dev". For the front-end terminal, cd into your front-end file and run the command "npm start". Make sure to run the back-end terminal before running your front-end terminal. This will allow you to view the application.
