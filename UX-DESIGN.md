## Wireframe Walkthrough

![homepage](/ux-design/wireframes/homepage-current-trips-mobile.png)

This is the main page of the application. Here you can view current and past trips, join new trips, or create a new trip. The back button would take you back to the sign-in page, and clicking on your profile pic would take you to your profile page. Since we are going through the main functionality of the app, let's assume we are trying to view a current trip. So, let's assume current trip is toggled (just like it's shown right now), and we click one of the current trips.

![locations](/ux-design/wireframes/sublocations-mobile.png)

Here, within a trip, we see the different locations within that trip(for example, if you are on a Europe trip you can have several different cities/countries you'd like to go to). You can add a new location, or even click share trip ID so you can share it with your friends and have them join your group trip. Let's check out what happens when we click a location. 

![activities](/ux-design/wireframes/activities-page-mobile.png)

Within a location, we can see the different activities that are suggested at that location. We can toggle between food/activities/stay, because those are independent from each other and don't really have anything to do with one another. We can also add a new activity, and most importantly, upvote and downvote the activities that we see. The more upvotes an activity has, the higher it is on the list. Now, let's see what happens if we want to see more details about an activity. 

![activities expanded](/ux-design/wireframes/activities-page-expanded-mobile.png)

It's simply a drop down with a description of the activity, along with the price range.

That's it! Of course, there are adjacent workflows (such as adding activities, locations, sharing the trip, logging in, viewing the profile page, and viewing past trips), but what you've seen is the core functionality of the app.
