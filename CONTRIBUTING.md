# Guide to Contributing

### Team Norms
#### Team Values
* Important agreements ensure that everyone knows what is expected in terms of responsibility:
* We will ensure a positive and supportive collaborative environment by enforcing the SCRUM methodology as well as the points below.
* We will ensure open channels of communication to resolve conflicts as well as handling any questions that developers may have. If we need, we will ask in the chat
* We will use a democratic vote to resolve issues that are team-wide. 
* If a team member fails to reach an obligatory task, we will determine the consequence based on the number of violations. For the first violation we will let them know, future violations are reported to the Professor and TAs. If there is a legitimate reason, team members must communicate ahead of time, such that the work can be reallocated appropriately.
* Team members are expected to respond within 1 day. All messages must have a response from at least one team member. Direct pinging/DM should be left to the LAST RESORT unless you are absolutely ghosted
* In an AGILE fashion, SCRUM master will lead the conversation. When a member of the team is speaking, other members should be silent. If the meeting is remote, members should mute themselves

#### Daily Standups
* Standups will occur on every business day.
* Members are expected to be present synchronously.
* Agreement that members will not cover for other members who do not participate.
### Coding Standards
* Don’t over-engineer. Write the minimum code needed to get things working end to end, then iterate to improve.
* Code for each task and spike must be peer-reviewed before being merged.
* Always push working code. If you break the pipeline/build, then fix it.
* Provide descriptive commit messages.
* Write self-documenting code. Use descriptive variable and function names. Avoid unnecessary name shortening.
* Don’t leave dead/commented-out code behind. If you see such code, delete it.
* When using JavaScript, try to use functional programming

### Git workflow
This will be expanded as we build out the project.

### Rules of contribution
This will be expanded as we build out the project.
* We will ensure the AGILE standards.
* We will make sure that contribution is done according to the GitHub board
and all points discussed in meetings.
* We will make sure that we follow all standards mentioned in Team Norms,
such as code legibility and commenting.
* We will ensure that PRs, merges, etc are done collaboratively - that is to say,
code will be reviewed before being merged, and thurough communication will be present.

### Setup for Local Development Environment
1. clone the repository
2. install all files via ```npm install```
3. ensure version compatibility

This will be expanded as we build out the project.
