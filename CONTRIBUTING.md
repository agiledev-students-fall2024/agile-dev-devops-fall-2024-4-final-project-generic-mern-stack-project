# Contributing 

## Norms

* Any spikes or issues will be made known to the other group members before the daily standup
* Standup meetings Tuesday's 13:45, Friday's 13:30, and Sunday's 18:00

## Git workflow

* Everything should get test coverage
* Don't merge to main without checking with at least one person
* Everyone work in their own feature branch

## Considerations

* Assign different scrum master and product owner each sprint. Rotate so that no one has same role back-to-back
* Assign user stories to each group member at standup meetings

## Local development

* Run in docker containers
* Snake case for backend and camel case for frontend
* 2 spaces for tabs
* Run formatters

## Building and Testing

* TBD
