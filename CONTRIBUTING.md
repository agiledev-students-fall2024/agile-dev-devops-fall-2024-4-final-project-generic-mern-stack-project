## Team Norms

### Team values
- The team meets three times a week on a zoom conference call to work together. 
- Team members complete their assigned tasks by the agreed upon due date.
- Team members are actively and effectively communicating with one another.
- If conflict arises, the team members will communicate either on the team discord channel or over zoom to come to an agreement.
- If a team member fails to deliver on their obligations, the other team members will first reach out and have a conversation about the situation. If this conversation does not resolve the issue, then the other team members will escalate the situation to the Professor and delegate the remaining tasks amongst themselves.
- Team members are expected to respond within 24 hrs of the messages being sent. 

### Sprint cadence
- On average, a sprint should take 2-3 weeks.

### Daily standups
- Daily Standups will take place on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Sundays from 5-6 pm. However, the team can change the time and date of the daily standups if the original schedule does not work for that week. 
- All members are expected to meet over zoom during the Daily Standups. 
- If a member does not attend a Daily Standup, then the Scrum Master will take note of it.
- Members who do not make progress on a task for two standups or more will be reported to the Professor. 

### Coding standards
- VScode with ESLint is the designated code editor for the team.
- Write the minimum code to get things working end to end. Once the initial code is running, then the team can work on improving the code in future iterations. 
- Code must be reviewed by the whole team before merging into the main branch of code.
- Always push working code. If there are bugs in the code, fix them before merging into the main branch.
- Make small commits per feature.
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Use descriptive variables and function names to avoid potential confusion.
- Remove commented out code.
- Write automated tests to cover critical integration points and functionality.
