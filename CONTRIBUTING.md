# Guide to Contributing

## Team Values and Principles

* Unified Effort: We believe that success comes from leveraging each person’s strengths and perspectives. Team collaboration is key to achieving our goals.
* Open Communication: We promote transparency and encourage sharing updates, ideas, and concerns openly to ensure that everyone is aligned.
* Growth Mindset: We’re committed to learning and improving as a team, embracing feedback, and adapting swiftly to changes.
*Proactive Engagement: Everyone on the team is expected to contribute actively. If you can’t attend a meeting or complete a task, communicate it early.
* Constructive Conflict Resolution: Disagreements are natural. We approach them constructively by listening, understanding, and reaching mutually beneficial solutions.
* Accountability: We trust each other to meet deadlines and deliver quality work. If someone struggles, the team will step in and provide support.
* Inclusivity: Every member is encouraged to share their thoughts. Diverse opinions lead to better decisions and innovation.

Team Rituals and Processes

Sprint Cadence

* Sprint Duration: We follow a two-week sprint cycle, ensuring that we maintain a steady workflow while leaving room for iteration and improvement.
* Planning & Review: At the start of each sprint, we align on key priorities. At the end, we reflect on progress, challenges, and areas of improvement.
* Adaptive Workflow: Task priorities are fluid and can be adjusted based on feedback or evolving project needs.

Standups

* Frequency: Standups are held on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to keep everyone informed and ensure that blockers are addressed quickly.
* Standup Format:
* Progress: Share what you’ve accomplished since the last standup.
* Plans: Outline your next tasks and goals.
* Problems: Highlight any blockers or challenges so the team can provide help.
Coding Standards

Development Approach

* Editor: We standardize on Visual Studio Code for consistency, but other editors are welcome as long as the team's workflow is not disrupted.
* Code Quality: Push code that works and is well-tested. If a feature isn’t ready, use draft pull requests for feedback.
* Peer Review Process: Every piece of code must be peer-reviewed to ensure quality, consistency, and adherence to team standards.
* Documentation: Write self-explanatory code. Use clear, meaningful variable and function names to avoid excessive comments.
